### Ruby
#### [Loan payoff calculator](https://github.com/cdpalmer/debt_payoff_calculator)
  
  Ruby script that will take in a hash of the details to all your loans, e.g. 
```
{
  title: "Sallie Mae",
  interest_rate: 0.065,
  original_balance: 10000,
  current_balance: 10000,
  min_payment: 200
},
{
  ...
}
```
   With that information, you can run the script with one input (how much you 
   budget towards debt) and it will spit out how many months it will take to pay
   off all of your debt using the avalanche method (however, could be tweaked easily
   to use the snowball method).  These methods are just what debts get paid first with
   any spare money you have each month.
   
#### [Boggle Solver](https://github.com/cdpalmer/boggle_solver)

Given a board and a Dictionary, it leverages a Trie to discover all words that are on 
the boggle board.  Used as follows:

```
master âœ” $ ruby boggle_the_ripper.rb
Starting Boggle Solver Engine!
 This is our working board:
    X X B X X
    X X A G X
    X E R X Y
    X X X X D
    X X X C O


*   Found word! (bag)
*   Found word! (bare)
*   Found word! (a)
*   Found word! (are)
*   Found word! (rag)
*   Found word! (gab)
*   Found word! (grab)
*   Found word! (cod)
*   Found word! (cody)
*   Found word! (doc)


 These are all found words:
["bag", "bare", "a", "are", "rag", "gab", "grab", "cod", "cody", "doc"]
```

### Java
#### Blackjack

Command line game where you could establish your budget and play blackjack.  It would
accept all actions (`Hit`, `Double Down`, `Split`, `Stand`), and you could play until
you ran out of money or the shoe is finished.  It would also keep a running count for
card counting and would quiz you what the running count was.  I have no idea where this
code is anymore.  Lost in the ether.

#### Trash can Mint

Loving nickname for a desktop Java app that would do a really crappy version of what
Mint currently does.  You would copy and paste your checking account transactions
(nope, didn't even use CSV... Hey! This was the first 4 months of my career!) where 
the app would parse all descriptions, deductions, and credits and give you a summary
of your monthly expenditures.  It also had an similar feature of the debt payoff calculator.
Code?  Also lost in the ether.


### Swift

#### Lumber Blackjack

Designed, coded, and deployed an iOS game that trains you to learn to play Basic Strategy.
Instead of the flash-card style that most apps use, you play a game that incrementally
teaches you different parts of Blackjack Basic Strategy.

### Rails

#### [Kangaroo](https://github.com/cdpalmer/kangaroo)

Ever go on movie marathons?  Or movie hop into another movie after the first one was over?
Well I made an app that pulled in all movie showtimes and theaters in a 15 mile radius
of a zip code you entered and would display to you every combination of movie marathons
you could see at a given theater.
